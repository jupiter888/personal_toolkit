# This script reads the CSV file into a DataFrame, and then writes the DataFrame to an Excel spreadsheet named 'example.xlsx' which is stored in the current working directory and sheet named 'Sheet1'.

# You can also use write.xlsx2 from the xlsx package to write dataframe to excel spreadsheet

write.xlsx2(df, excel_file, sheetName = "Sheet1", row.names = FALSE)

# You can also use openxlsx package to write dataframe to excel spreadsheet with additional options for formatting cells, adding charts and more

# This script writes the DataFrame to a new Excel file, which is stored in the current working directory with the name 'example.xlsx'

library(openxlsx)

# create a new Excel file and add a worksheet
wb <- createWorkbook()

# write the DataFrame to the worksheet
